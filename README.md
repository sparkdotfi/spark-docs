## **Spark Documentation Portal**

The Spark Documentation Portal is your one stop place for all user documentation relating to Spark. Here you will find user tutorials, high level concepts and developer documentation.

### Spark Products

**Spark** is on a mission to empower the USDS ecosystem, as part of the [Sky Ecosystem](https://sky.money).

Spark consists of three main product categories:

* **Savings**: Earn savings on your stablecoin holdings.
* **SparkLend**: The USDS and DAI centric money market protocol. Combining the best liquidity directly from Sky and vertically integrating with the best DeFi protocols.
* **Spark Liquidity Layer:** Direct liquidity provision into DeFi markets.

You will find documentation for all of these products in the sections below:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>User Guides</strong></td><td>Learn how to use the Spark products</td><td><a href="user-guides/getting-started.md">getting-started.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rewards</strong></td><td>Learn about current rewards programmes</td><td><a href="rewards/spk-token.md">spk-token.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Developer Documentation</strong></td><td>Learn how to develop integrations with Spark products</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/HdgfPReNaJoFbN7B3nr5/s/JoPOn9EuKR5wJyQRcvjo/">Spark Dev Docs</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Beware of scams and fake accounts

Be careful, it is common for scammers to create fake social media accounts and websites that mimic Spark products or services to steal user funds. Therefore always ensure you are only using the official Spark products on the official domain.

The legitimate Spark domain is:

* [https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi)

Any subdomain based on the above domains will also be legitimate, such as docs.spark.fi

Beware of the following:

* Domains that look similar but are not **exactly** the same, it can be a single character or different top-level domain (.com, .net, .scam)
* Clickable domains on social media, these can look legitimate on the platform, such as Twitter, but once clicked the user is redirected to a different domain.
* People who contact you via social media, including Twitter, Telegram and LinkedIn claiming to be a contributor of Spark. Always verify their identity by asking on the public discord or with someone that you trust.
* Websites without https (http does not provide encryption nor verification)
* Any Spark mobile application
* Any website asking you for your seed passphrase (you should not share this with anyone)&#x20;
* Spark does not advertise on social media (e.g. tweets with "Ad" on the top right), on websites or search engines.
